### A collection of Unity UIElements animation extension methods, new animated elements, and examples.

### Note: UIElements Animations are listed as Experimental by Unity - API subject to change. Also, since Element Animation Toolkit is currently underactive development, it is possible for API changes in this library as well

#### The intent of this package is to help asset developers more easily create their own animation sequences via code.  

Though, I have been adding some new "ready to go" UIElement types, such as the "AnimatedFoldout", which you just use as you would a a typical foldout comes animated with no additional coding, minus some exposed properties to adjust the animation to your liking. I do intend to add more of these as I go along.  

This package began simply as a small collection of helpers methods I created across my last few projects to make animating editor elements much easier and finally put into a single place. I continue to add to it as I go along but decided to put together several examples and wanted to share them.
