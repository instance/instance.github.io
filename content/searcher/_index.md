Searcher brings the “Search Everything” functionality found in many modern Content Creation Suites and IDE’s such as JetBrains ‘Shift+Shift’ search (PyCharm, Rider, Webstorm, etc), Blender, Maya, and many others, to Houdini. 

Quickly locate and execute any menu item or hotkeyable action without the need to assign, memorize, or manage hotkeys.

**Greatly increase productivity.** Spend less time trying to locate nested menu items or remembering hundreds of hotkeys  
**Optimized for responsiveness.** Utilizes libraries written in C to maximize speed  
**Search for any available native or 3rd party menu items or actions.** Locates available 3rd party menus/actions/hotkeys  
**Fuzzy, abbreviated, partial search via FTS5 engine.** Ex. Quickly locate "External Tool Preferences" by typing "ex to pre"  
**Show all available actions for windows/panes/contexts.** Mouseover a window and press hotkey to display the available actions/hotkeys  
**Open menu items/trigger actions from the Searcher window.** Execute available actions even if they don't have a hotkey assigned  

**Feature requests welcome and encouraged!** If you think Searcher could benefit from an additional feature, let us know!
