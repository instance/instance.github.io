MMORPG KIT 1.32 — Character Database / Entity workflow changes
==============================================================

From the previous version I have made **Entity Prefab** field located at **Base Character** class

But from 1.32, **Character Entity** will have **Database** field, we will set Character data into it

Then we have to set **Character Entity** into **Game Database** or place it in **Resources** folder

Then you will have to set monster character entity to monster spawn area

Why I change it ?, the main reasons is I going to implement job change system but we also able to use it when creating character with choice character’s of jobs
