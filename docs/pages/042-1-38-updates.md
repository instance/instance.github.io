==============

*   Move Dimension Type configs to Game Instance  
    I move **Dimension Type** configs from **Monster Spawn Area, Harvestable Spawn Area, Item Drop Entity, Missile Damage Entity and Player Character Controller** to **Game Instance.** I think it’s more convenient.

*   Can use Item Refine to define item rarity (can use its title as rarity such as Normal, Magic, Rare, Legendary)
