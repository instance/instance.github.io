Then setup character model component based on dimension (2D or 3D) and animation type.

## 3D Character Model

*   **[Animator Character Model](pages/108-animator-character-model ':target=__blank')**, This character model will support **[Mechanim Animation System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html ':target=__blank')** only, it's using pre-made animator controller then override it at runtime to change animation but it's allow to make custom animator controller too with some conditions.
*   **[Animation Character Model](pages/107-animation-character-model ':target=__blank')**, This character model will support **[Legacy Animation System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Animations.html ':target=__blank')** only.
*   **[Character Model](pages/106-character-model ':target=__blank')**, This is the old one which supports both **[Legacy Animation System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Animations.html ':target=__blank')** and **[Mechanim Animation System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html ':target=__blank')** but it's harder to use.

## 2D Character Model

*   **[Character Model 2D](pages/109-character-model-2d ':target=__blank')**, This is character model for 2D game, it's use `Animation Clip 2D` to manage animation's frames
