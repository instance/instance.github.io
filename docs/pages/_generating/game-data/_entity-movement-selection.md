*   **Nav Mesh Entity Movement** If you planned to make your character to move by nav mesh system, use this entity movement.

## 2D Entity Movement

*   **Rigid Body Entity Movement 2D** For 2D games, there is only one built-in entity movement, if you want to use another entity movement which integrate [A* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar). You can get it from: [UnityMultiplayerARPG_2DAI](https://github.com/insthync/UnityMultiplayerARPG_2DAI).
