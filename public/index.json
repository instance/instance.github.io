	"content": "Installation | Compatability Details Thanks for checking out Searcher. Below are the instructions to get you up and running.\nInstall   Extract/unzip \u0026lsquo;Searcher_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;.zip\u0026rsquo;. (ex. Searcher_v0.1.0.zip) Inside will be a packages and Searcher folder as well as a README.md and a url link to this page.\nSearcher_v0.1.0.zip /\rSearcher_v0.1.0/__ /packages/\r|_ /Searcher/\r|__ README.md\r|__ Searcher_install_instructions.url\r  Move the Searcher folder somewhere permanent. It can be placed where ever you would like. Make note of the folder path, as it will be needed in a later step. Examples below:\n   OS Path (replace \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; with your actual username)     Windows: C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;\\houdini_addons\\Searcher   Linux: /home/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/houdini_addons/Searcher   MacOS: /Users/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/Library/h_addons/Searcher      Move the \u0026lsquo;packages\u0026rsquo; folder into your Houdini $HOME directory. The locations are seen below:\n   OS Path (replace \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; with your actual username)     Windows: C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;\\Documents\\houdini18.0\\packages\\Searcher.json   Linux: /home/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/houdini18.0/packages/Searcher.json   MacOS: /Users/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/Library/Preferences/houdini/18.0/packages/Searcher.json      Within the \u0026lsquo;packages\u0026rsquo; folder is the Searcher.json file. Open this file in your editor of choice and edit line #27. Within the second set of quotation marks input the path to the Searcher folder from step #2. On Windows, replace the backslashes (\\) in the path with a forwardslashs (/) Ex. If using Windows and following the example listed above, line 27 would look like this:\n \u0026quot;SEARCHERLOCATION\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;C:/Users/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/houdini_addons/Searcher\u0026quot;,\r  Save the file and start Houdini.
